Project Description:
=====================

�Wall building� application would help in the automation of the process of construction. 

This project aims at easing the entire process and providing a helping hand to the labourers. In this, we aim at designing a system with a camera and a robotic machine that will communicate with each other to perform the task of wall building. The ceiling camera will capture the image of the arena and feed the processed co-ordinates to the robot. The robot will then according to the fed co-ordinates, will place the bricks accordingly on the white strip.

Technologies Used:
===================

+   Embedded C
+   Xbee
+   Specialized Hardware
+   AVR BOOTLOADER
+   MATLAB
+   AVR Studio

Installation Instructions:
===========================

Before starting the execution, user should ensure that he has all the files mentioned in code files section such as "final.c" and "matlabwb.m".

Follow the instructions below:
�	Open AVR Studio and make new project.
�	Add "final.c" in source file 
�	Ensure to check box related to hex file creation in configuration setting.
�	Compile the code.
�	Connect the firebird V programmer on to the PC in which this code exists.
�	Burn this code into Firebird V.
�	Attach overhead USB camera at some height and plug-in into PC. 
�	Run the Matlab code on the PC connected with a Zigbee module (make change to the code according to the port number to which Zigbee is connected).
�	Now switch on the Firebird.
�	The Firebird will start working and will respond according to the co-ordinates sent by the Matlab code.
